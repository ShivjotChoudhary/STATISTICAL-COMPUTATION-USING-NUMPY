## 🌸 Species-Wise Comparison

The dataset is separated into:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

For each species:

* Mean comparison
* Variance comparison
* Standard deviation comparison
* Range comparison
* Correlation analysis

### 📊 Key Observations

* **Setosa**:

  * Lowest variance
  * Compact cluster
  * Easily separable from other species

* **Versicolor**:

  * Moderate spread
  * Overlaps slightly with Virginica

* **Virginica**:

  * Highest variance
  * Largest petal measurements
  * More spread-out distribution

### 🎯 Statistical Insight for ML

* Petal length & width are the most discriminative features.
* Strong correlation between petal length and width.
* Statistical properties explain why classification models perform well.
* Setosa is linearly separable due to low variance.
